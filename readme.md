#### Project Summary
This tool uses a basic encryption method called Caesar Cipher to generate a coded message. Basically, the method shifts the letters in your original message by a certain number (which we'll refer to as the "shift").

For instance, if you choose a "shift" of 4, the cipher will shift the letters of your message 4 places forward like this:

A -----> E\
B -----> F\
C -----> G\
... .. ...\
... .. ...\
Y -----> C\
Z -----> D

So, suppose your message is:

***"The enemy will attack tonight!"***

And, you want to encrypt it by a shift of 4. Then, your encrypted message will be:

***"Xli iriqc ampp exxego xsrmklx!"***

Try it out yourself, either by running the code or by encrypting the message manually!

**Decryption**

This tool can also decrypt your encrypted messages by reversing the logic used for encryption. So, you can also feed the encrypted message above:

***"Xli iriqc ampp exxego xsrmklx!"***

to get your original message:

***"The enemy will attack tonight!"***
